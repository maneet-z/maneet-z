### Welcome 👋🏼

I’m a Data Scientist based in Toronto, ON with a passion for discovering how data is revolutionizing our world. Leveraging my background in Machine Learning, I help data-driven companies to find the story hidden beneath their data, intuitively and meaningfully. I love chatting about machine learning, data privacy ethics and the application of AI in Healthcare. Apart from that, I love cooking Indian vegetarian dishes with some extra spice.
